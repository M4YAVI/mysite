        content: `
In a world obsessed with "more"—more features, more speed, more connection—the act of subtraction becomes a radical design choice. It's not about emptiness for emptiness's sake, but about clarity.

When we remove the non-essential, we give the essential room to breathe. We allow the user to focus on what truly matters. This isn't just aesthetic; it's functional.

Every element you add to a screen increases the cognitive load. Every pixel competes for attention. By rigorously subtracting, we respect the user's mental energy.

        content: `
We build mirrors that reflect our intelligence back at us, but sometimes the reflection seems to move on its own. The "ghost in the machine" is no longer just a philosophical concept; it's a debugging challenge.

As LLMs become more convincing, the line between "simulating understanding" and "understanding" blurs. Does it matter if the machine feels, if it can make us feel?

The "publish" button feels final. A digital garden is never finished. It grows, weeds appear, branches are pruned.

I'm moving away from the concept of a "blog post" towards "notes" and "explorations". This site itself is a garden.

        content: `
Notifications, badges, popups. The modern web screams at you. Designing for silence means creating interfaces that wait for you to initiate interaction.

It's about passive availability rather than active intrusion.
