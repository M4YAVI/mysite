        content: `
        <p>In a world obsessed with "more"—more features, more speed, more connection—the act of subtraction becomes a radical design choice. It's not about emptiness for emptiness's sake, but about clarity.</p>
        <p>When we remove the non-essential, we give the essential room to breathe. We allow the user to focus on what truly matters. This isn't just aesthetic; it's functional.</p>
        <p>Every element you add to a screen increases the cognitive load. Every pixel competes for attention. By rigorously subtracting, we respect the user's mental energy.</p>

        <p>We build mirrors that reflect our intelligence back at us, but sometimes the reflection seems to move on its own. The "ghost in the machine" is no longer just a philosophical concept; it's a debugging challenge.</p>
        <p>As LLMs become more convincing, the line between "simulating understanding" and "understanding" blurs. Does it matter if the machine feels, if it can make us feel?</p>
