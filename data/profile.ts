    description: `I’m into Full Stack and AI, but I’m just as obsessed with history, literature, and good storytelling. I’m picky about what I watch and read and even pickier about what I create. I like things clean, well thought out, and efficient.
    
I like understanding how systems behave, whether it’s an algorithm, a government, or a character in a novel. I get invested in ideas that reveal how people think, what they fear, and what they decide to do anyway. That kind of thing sticks with me more than any hype cycle.`,
